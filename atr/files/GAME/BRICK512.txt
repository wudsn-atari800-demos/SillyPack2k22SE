Title:   Bricks 512
Author:  Ralf Patschke
         aka PPs

Info:    Mono
         Now runs from DOS 2.5

Tiny game for A8 created between
July, 17th and 22th

What to do?
Erase all of those 18 bricks :)

How to play?
Use Paddle A and press its trigger
to start game.

The game performs a reboot after a
win or loss.

Initially I wanted to try, if I could
crunch this into a 256 byte game.
Soon I realised, that I am not able
to do so, so next aim was 512 bytes,
but now I wanted to have sound and
direction change, if ball hits left
and right edges of paddle.
Goal achieved :)

Known bugs:
Sometimes a brick is not cleared
correctly when it is hit. Then the
game counts cleared bricks wrong.

Stay ATARI! - PPs
