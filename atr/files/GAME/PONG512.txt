Title:   Pong 512
Author:  Ralf Patschke
         aka PPs

Info:    Mono
         Now runs from DOS 2.5
         Single player vs. CPU game
         Beatable

Very simple Pong clone that is just
some sectors in length.

Press button on paddle 0 to play
after loading has finished.
Players should use paddles to play.
2 player mode uses both paddles in
port one of ATARI. First player who
gets 9 points wins. Game will reboot
after a short break at the end.

Initially I planned to have all
within 384 bytes, but later I wanted
to be able to beat the CPU in one
player game. This caused in a length
above 384 bytes, so I wanted to add
some sound and the mid screen line
and changed aim to 512 bytes. I am
sure, that there is potential
to optimize it better, but atm I am
fine with the results.
