I always liked the 1992 Party-Zanci
Amiga demo by Joker, a great idea
which was followed by part 2 and 3
on the Amiga as well as a ZX Spectrum
version in 2017.
This 256-byte Atari demo is a tribute
to that, introducing some additional
gender diversity, out of which new 
and wonderful things may be born! :-)
