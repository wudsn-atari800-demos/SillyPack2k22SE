Title:   SV22SE 8-Bit Unity Demo
Author:  Ralf Patschke
         aka PPs

Info:    Mono

I just did a small demonstration for
both A8 and Lynx using 8-bit unity.
So this is my first ever Lynx and C
code. Don't expect any special
effects and feel free to use anything
of this.

All sources are in 8bit-unity.zip.
Should be plug and play, if you copy
it into main dir of 8-bit Unity.

Because 8-bit Unity only creates a
bootable disk, you cannot start the
demo from the SillyPack menu.

You have to open the separate
SillyPack2k22SE-8-bit-Unity.atr
from the download archive.
